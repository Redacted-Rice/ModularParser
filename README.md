# Modular Parser
A generic an modular parser for reading in custom Domain Specific Languages

This code functions and works well but after continuing development I decided to go for a LUA bases scripting language for my project.
The main reason for this is that as I continued on implementation, I wanted more and more full scripting support.
Secondly I realized that I was really fighting Java to do this while other languages like lua were built for such things.

As such I have no plans to continue development on this project.

For best context on how to use, see the functional tests I had created for this project
