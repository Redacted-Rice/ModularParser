No more plans to update or enhance. See README for more details

Some ideas that were not done but would be nice if developed picked back up again:
Add basic math expression parsing/evaluation
Be consistent with parse/evaluate for literals
Add parenthesis support in expressions (particularly for math support)
Handle streams in var assignment? Have a copy function or similar to call? Or maybe an arg from eval literal
